# UnitConverter
Unit Converter, or The Ultimate Conversion Program, is a simple GUI program written in C# that can convert different units of
measurement. Updates will be coming soon, with an automatic updater, as well as more units of measurement, to be added soon.

# How To Install
You can find the first release on the releases tab on Github. Otherwise, download the source code and compile it manually with
Visual Studio.

# Future Plans
I have several future plans, but don't expect an ETA.
1. Option to round the output
2. Auto-Updater
3. More units of measure (Currently implementing some Imperial units)
This can be quite time consuming, so implementing any new unit takes a while.

# Feedback
**Constructive** feedback is welcome! Leave it in the issues section.
